# Test-Maker

Test-Maker is a tool for creating perfect Multiple Choice exams with multiple versions.

## Introduction

The worst feeling on exam day is distributing the exam questions and then realizing there was a mistake on the exam.  People make mistakes, and when making an exam by hand, it's all too easy to copy-and-paste incorrectly.

With Test-Maker, a computer handles all the stuff that computers do best.  Exams never have duplicate questions and it's easy to ensure the answer keys are generated perfectly too.  This process is repeatable, so once you've generated your first successful exam, you can count on future exams to work perfectly too.
